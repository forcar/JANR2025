Run the 'make' script to execute the Makefile in the build dir, then use the 'run' script to run the janr executable. The janr executable reads 'janr_input' and writes output files janrpi0p01.dat and janrpipn01.dat.  These should be identical to the files in the output dir, which were created when the code was last used in 2016.  These files contain observables for pi0-p and pi+n final states listed in lines 171-188 in janr_bosted_2016.F.  Note this code no longer has routines to perform fitting, because the MINUIT libaries generate fatal errors when attempting to run the executable.
